    "The capital of Australia is Canberra. The name 'Canberra' was officially adopted and the city founded in 1913, following a decision to create a new capital rather than choose Sydney or Melbourne.",
    "Precision is TP/(TP+FP) and measures the correctness of positive predictions. Recall is TP/(TP+FN) and measures coverage of actual positives. There is often a trade-off between the two.",
    "Active recall, spaced repetition, and the Feynman technique are three evidence-backed study methods. Each has pros and cons depending on the learner and material."
